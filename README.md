# Spell-Checker
This Spell Checker works on the concept of Minimum Edit Distance (number of insertions, deletions and substitution) to find the best word. The dictionary is a database consisting of several words related to Computer Science. If a misspelled word is entered, the program returns the best spelled word from the dictionary database.
